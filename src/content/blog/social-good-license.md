In the fast-evolving world of technology, open-source software is a cornerstone of innovation and collaboration. The freedoms granted by licenses like the MIT License have empowered developers to create and share their work without restrictive barriers

However, as the impact of technology on society and the environment becomes increasingly significant, perhaps there is a way to introduce incentives to the traditional licenses to include specific and measurable ethical restrictions on the use of software. The aim of this would be to encourage responsible and ethical organisations while maintaining the openness that fuels innovation.

## Key Features of an Ideal Ethical Software License

An effective ethical software license would need to balance freedom with responsibility. Here are some key features such a license could include:

### 1. Freedom for Individuals and Small Organizations

The license should grant individuals and small organizations (e.g., those with fewer than 50 workers and less than $5 million USD in annual revenue) the same freedoms provided by permissive licenses like the MIT License. This would ensure that innovation and collaboration remain unhampered for smaller entities.

### 2. Ethical Conditions for Larger Organizations

Larger organizations, which have a more significant impact on society and the environment, would be required to meet specific ethical criteria to use, modify, or distribute the software. This would ensure that their increased capabilities and resources are used responsibly.

### 4. Controlled Redistribution

To maintain the integrity of these ethical standards, redistribution of the software would be allowed only if the recipient also meets the criteria for an individual, small organization, or qualifies as an ethical organization.

## Criteria for Ethical Organizations

To implement such a license, we need clear and measurable criteria that define what it means to be an ethical organization. Further the aim should not be to restrict organisations from being able to use the software, but rather to encourage organisations that are not yet meeting the criteria to improve themselves so as to meet the criteria and allow themselves to use the software. Therefore, the license would need to have a definition that is achievable for organisations that are not yet socially good.

Here are some ideas for what a social good criteria could include:

1. Transparency and Accountability
    1. Public disclosure of operational information, including financial statements and social responsibility initiatives.
    1. Annual independent audits to verify the accuracy of disclosures and adherence to ethical standards.
    1. Mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, including public consultations and feedback mechanisms.
1. Ethical Business Practices
    1. Robust anti-corruption policies and regular training for workers.
    1. Fair labor practices, including fair wages, union support, and safe working conditions, verified through third-party audits.
    1. Ensuring suppliers and partners comply with ethical standards, including human rights and environmental considerations.
1. Environmental Sustainability
    1. Specific targets for reducing the carbon footprint, verified through third-party audits.
    1. Effective waste management strategies, including recycling and proper disposal of hazardous materials.
    1. Measures to protect and promote biodiversity, such as habitat conservation and reforestation projects.
1. Social Impact
    1. Promotion of diversity and inclusion within the workforce.
1. Governance and Ethical Leadership
    1. Diverse representation on the board of directors.
    1. Regular ethics training for all workers.
    1. Robust whistleblower protection programs to report unethical behavior without fear of retaliation.

## <cite>An Example License for Social Good [^1]</cite>

[^1]: This license has not been verified by a legal authority and therefore cannot guarantee effectiveness, it is just an example to offer a sample of what a social good license could be like.

To illustrate how such a license could work in practice, here's the GOOD License (Good Organization Open Development License). This license embodies the principles discussed above providing a practical example of how ethical considerations can be integrated into software licensing.

To adopt the GOOD License for your software project, simply include the GOOD License text in your project's repository and ensure that contributors and users are aware of the terms.

Alternatively, why not create your own license that adheres to your idea of a socially good organisation?
