## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro project, there is the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where the Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components reside.

The `src/content/` directory contains ["collections"](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) of related Markdown and MDX documents. `getCollection()` is used to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check the frontmatter using the schema.

Any static assets, like images, are placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
